Tree Borrows is a proposed alternative to
[Stacked Borrows](https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/05/21/stacked-borrows-2.1.html)
that fulfills the same role: to analyse the execution of Rust code at runtime
(so actually MIR rather than Rust) and declare the precise requirements of the aliasing constraints.
When the aliasing assumptions are considered to have been violated, the code is declared UB.

---

The current version of Tree Borrows is implemented in the
[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/tree/master/src/borrow_tracker/tree_borrows)
interpreter.
Compared to [the detailed description](https://github.com/Vanille-N/tree-borrows/blob/master/half/main.pdf),
this document is more example-oriented.
