Tree Borrows is a proposed alternative to
[Stacked Borrows](https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/05/21/stacked-borrows-2.1.html)
that fulfills the same role: to analyse the execution of Rust code at runtime
and define the precise requirements of the aliasing constraints.
When these aliasing constraints are violated, the code is declared
Undefined Behavior (UB). This enables optimizations that would otherwise be
unsound in the presence of `unsafe`{.rust} code.

The current version of Tree Borrows is
[implemented](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/tree/master/src/borrow_tracker/tree_borrows)
in the
[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/)
interpreter.
Compared to [another description](https://github.com/Vanille-N/tree-borrows/blob/master/half/main.pdf),
this document is more example-oriented.
